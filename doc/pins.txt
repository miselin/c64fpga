Mapping:
- 5 VDC => Mercury 5 VDC input
- GND => Ground network
- IO => Mercury 5V-tolerant GPIO

Expansion Port
==============

44 pins. 2.54mm pitch (0.1"). 2-row edge (both sides of PCB).

- 2x 5 VAC
- 4x GND
- 38x IO (two clocks, 36 IO pins)

Mapping:
- 5 VDC => Mercury 5 VDC input
- GND => Ground network
- 30x IO => Mercury 5V-tolerant GPIO
- 8x IO (2 clocks, 6 data pins) => Level Shifters + High-Speed IO
